    ChatMessageModel(text = "That's good. What about avoiding screens before bedtime?", isUser = false),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "I usually watch TV or check my phone before sleeping. Is that bad?", isUser = true),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "The blue light from screens can interfere with melatonin production. Try avoiding screens 1-2 hours before bed.", isUser = false),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "I didn't know that. I'll try to read a book instead.", isUser = true),

    ChatMessageModel(text = "I usually have coffee until about 4pm. Is that too late?", isUser = true),

    ChatMessageModel(text = "I work out in the evenings. Is that good timing?", isUser = true),

    ChatMessageModel(text = "Wonderful! Another suggestion is to use your bed only for sleep, not for working or watching TV.", isUser = false),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "I do tend to work from bed sometimes. I'll stop that habit.", isUser = true),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "Great! Your brain will start to associate your bed with sleep rather than alertness.", isUser = false),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "Makes sense. What about naps during the day?", isUser = true),

    ChatMessageModel(text = "Good choice. What about your bedroom environment? Is it comfortable?", isUser = false),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "I think so, but my mattress is quite old.", isUser = true),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "An uncomfortable mattress can definitely impact sleep quality. Consider investing in a new one if possible.", isUser = false),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "I've been thinking about it. Any recommendations for mattress type?", isUser = true),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "It depends on your preferences - memory foam, innerspring, hybrid, etc. Test different types if you can.", isUser = false),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "I'll do some research and testing. What about pillows?", isUser = true),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "A good pillow that properly supports your neck is important. Replace pillows every 1-2 years.", isUser = false),
    ChatMessageModel(text = "Mine are definitely older than that! I'll get new ones.", isUser = true),
