        ChatMessage(text = "I do tend to work from bed sometimes. I'll stop that habit.", isUser = true),

        ChatMessage(text = "It depends on your preferences - memory foam, innerspring, hybrid, etc. Test different types if you can.", isUser = false),
        ChatMessage(text = "I'll do some research and testing. What about pillows?", isUser = true),
        ChatMessage(text = "A good pillow that properly supports your neck is important. Replace pillows every 1-2 years.", isUser = false),
